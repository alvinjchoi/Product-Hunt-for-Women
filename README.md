ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces specifically for single page applications. It's used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create re-usable UI components.

React allows developers to create large web applications which can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It only works on user interfaces in application, which cooreponds to 'view' in the MVC template.
